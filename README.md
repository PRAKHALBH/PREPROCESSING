# MachineLearning_is_FUN
This repo contains all the projects and python notebooks that I am doing and studying to dive deeper in ML.(From Data Preprocessing to more complex models). My study resources include online-courses form Udemy, Udacity and Coursera.
All the python notebooks will be about some concepts that I've studied and then their implementatin and also there gonna be some live projects that I'll be scribbling here.

## Requirements
I am coding into the jupyter notebooks. In order to run the ipython notebooks you can do two things 
* Install jupyter-notebook on your machine
  * You can install in by using a python distribution like anaconda(Jupyter comes preinstalled in anaconda)
  * You can install jupyter notebook to your machine, follow this [link](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "Jupyter Docs")
  
* Convert the python notebook to python file
    >
        From the command line you can convert a notebook to python with this command:

        ipython nbconvert --to python <YourNotebook>.ipynb
        You may have to install the python mistune package:

        sudo pip install mistune
        
    or follow this [stack overflow sol](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35545402/how-to-run-an-ipynb-jupyter-notebook-from-terminal)
